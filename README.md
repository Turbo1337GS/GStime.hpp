# GStime.hpp

This header file defines a C++ class called `GStime` that represents a time in hours, minutes, and seconds. It provides various member functions and overloaded operators to perform operations on time objects.

## Class Description

The `GStime` class has the following private member variables:

- `hours`: represents the number of hours
- `minutes`: represents the number of minutes
- `seconds`: represents the number of seconds

The class provides the following public member functions:

- `GStime()`: default constructor that initializes the time to 0 hours, 0 minutes, and 0 seconds.
- `GStime(int h, int m, int s)`: constructor that allows initializing the time with custom values.
- `void setTime(int h, int m, int s)`: sets the time to the specified values.
- `int getHours() const`: returns the number of hours.
- `int getMinutes() const`: returns the number of minutes.
- `int getSeconds() const`: returns the number of seconds.
- `void addSeconds(int s)`: adds the specified number of seconds to the time.
- `void addMinutes(int m)`: adds the specified number of minutes to the time.
- `void addHours(int h)`: adds the specified number of hours to the time.
- `void subtractSeconds(int s)`: subtracts the specified number of seconds from the time.
- `void subtractMinutes(int m)`: subtracts the specified number of minutes from the time.
- `void subtractHours(int h)`: subtracts the specified number of hours from the time.
- `GStime operator+(const GStime& other) const`: overloads the `+` operator to add two time objects.
- `GStime operator-(const GStime& other) const`: overloads the `-` operator to subtract two time objects.
- `GStime& operator+=(const GStime& other)`: overloads the `+=` operator to add another time object to the current time object.
- `GStime& operator-=(const GStime& other)`: overloads the `-=` operator to subtract another time object from the current time object.
- `GStime operator+(int seconds) const`: overloads the `+` operator to add a specified number of seconds to the time object.
- `GStime operator-(int seconds) const`: overloads the `-` operator to subtract a specified number of seconds from the time object.
- `GStime& operator++()`: overloads the prefix `++` operator to increment the time object by 1 second.
- `GStime operator++(int)`: overloads the postfix `++` operator to increment the time object by 1 second and return the previous value.
- `GStime& operator--()`: overloads the prefix `--` operator to decrement the time object by 1 second.
- `GStime operator--(int)`: overloads the postfix `--` operator to decrement the time object by 1 second and return the previous value.
- `bool operator==(const GStime& other) const`: overloads the `==` operator to compare two time objects for equality.
- `bool operator!=(const GStime& other) const`: overloads the `!=` operator to compare two time objects for inequality.
- `bool operator<(const GStime& other) const`: overloads the `<` operator to compare two time objects.
- `bool operator>(const GStime& other) const`: overloads the `>` operator to compare two time objects.
- `bool operator<=(const GStime& other) const`: overloads the `<=` operator to compare two time objects.
- `bool operator>=(const GStime& other) const`: overloads the `>=` operator to compare two time objects.
- `int toSeconds() const`: converts the time object to the total number of seconds.
- `static GStime fromSeconds(int seconds)`: creates a new time object from the specified number of seconds.
- `int getTotalMinutes() const`: returns the total number of minutes represented by the time object.
- `int getTotalHours() const`: returns the total number of hours represented by the time object.
- `GStime getTimeDifference(const GStime& other) const`: returns the time difference between the current time object and another time object.
- `GStime to12HourFormat() const`: converts the time object to the 12-hour format.
- `std::string toAMPMFormat() const`: returns the time object in the format "HH:MM:SS AM/PM".
- `std::string toString() const`: returns the time object in the format "HH:MM:SS".
- `std::string toFullString() const`: returns the time object in the format "HH:MM:SS AM/PM".

The class also provides several static member functions for common time operations, such as calculating the sum of multiple time objects, adding or subtracting time from a given time object, getting the difference between two time objects in seconds, minutes, or hours, and checking if a time is valid or empty.

## Operator Overloading

The `GStime` class overloads the following operators:

- `+`, `-`, `+=`, `-=`, `++`, `--` for performing arithmetic operations on time objects.
- `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` for comparing time objects.
- `<<` for outputting the time object to an output stream.

## Additional Functions

The header file also defines several global functions that operate on time objects:

- `GStime operator+(int seconds, const GStime& time)`: overloads the `+` operator to add a specified number of seconds to a time object.
- `GStime operator-(int seconds, const GStime& time)`: overloads the `-` operator to subtract a specified number of seconds from a time object.
- `GStime operator*(const GStime& time, int factor)`: overloads the `*` operator to multiply a time object by a factor.
- `GStime operator*(int factor, const GStime& time)`: overloads the `*` operator to multiply a time object by a factor.
- `GStime operator/(const GStime& time, int divisor)`: overloads the `/` operator to divide a time object by a divisor.
- `GStime operator%(const GStime& time, int divisor)`: overloads the `%` operator to get the remainder of dividing a time object by a divisor.
- `bool operator<(const GStime& time, int seconds)`: overloads the `<` operator to compare a time object with a specified number of seconds.
- `bool operator>(const GStime& time, int seconds)`: overloads the `>` operator to compare a time object with a specified number of seconds.

## Example Usage

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "GStime.hpp"

int main() {
    GStime time1(1, 30, 45);
    GStime time2(0, 45, 30);
    GStime time3 = time1 + time2;

    std::cout << "Time 1: " << time1 << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Time 2: " << time2 << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Time 3: " << time3 << std::endl;

    if (time1 == time2) {
        std::cout << "Time 1 is equal to Time 2" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Time 1 is not equal to Time 2" << std::endl;
    }

    time3 += GStime(0, 0, 15);
    std::cout << "Time 3 after adding 15 seconds: " << time3 << std::endl;

    time3 += GStime(0, 20, 0); 
    std::cout << "Time 3 after adding 20 minutes: " << time3 << std::endl;

    time3 += GStime(2, 0, 0); 
    std::cout << "Time 3 after adding 2 hours: " << time3 << std::endl;

    GStime time4 = time3 - GStime(0, 40, 0); 
    std::cout << "Time 4 after subtracting 40 minutes from Time 3: " << time4 << std::endl;

    GStime time5 = GStime(0, 0, 10) + time2; 
    std::cout << "Time 5 after adding 10 seconds to Time 2: " << time5 << std::endl;

    GStime timeArray[] = { time1, time2, time3, time4, time5 };
    GStime totalTime = GStime::sumTimes(timeArray, sizeof(timeArray) / sizeof(GStime));
    std::cout << "Total time: " << totalTime << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Output

```
Time 1: 1h 30m 45s
Time 2: 0h 45m 30s
Time 3: 2h 16m 15s
Time 1 is not equal to Time 2
Time 3 after adding 15 seconds: 2h 16m 30s
Time 3 after adding 20 minutes: 2h 36m 30s
Time 3 after adding 2 hours: 4h 36m 30s
Time 4 after subtracting 40 minutes from Time 3: 3h 56m 30s
Time 5 after adding 10 seconds to Time 2: 0h 45m 40s
